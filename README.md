# Semenova Valeriia 
## My project is presented in the form of a game "Ð¥/O".
### Rules of the game:
Two players participate in the game, one of whom is responsible for the _X sign_, and the other for the _O sign_. On each turn, players must place an O or an X on a 3 by 3 grid. The first player to place three identical symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

### Instructions for using the assembled program:
When starting to work, the program asks the user for the number of the row and column in which the player wants to place his sign. Numbering starts from zero. First you need to specify a row, then a column.

***Examples with using the game***:
